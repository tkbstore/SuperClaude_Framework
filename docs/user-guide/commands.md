## 📊 Command Output Categories

### Document-Only Commands (STOP after output)
These commands produce documents/reports and DO NOT implement:
- `/sc:brainstorm` → Requirements specification
- `/sc:workflow` → Implementation plan
- `/sc:spawn` → Task hierarchy
- `/sc:research` → Research report
- `/sc:estimate` → Estimation report
- `/sc:design` → Architecture documents
- `/sc:analyze` → Analysis report
- `/sc:spec-panel` → Expert review document
- `/sc:business-panel` → Business analysis document
- `/sc:troubleshoot` → Diagnostic report (fixes require `--fix` flag + confirmation)

### Execution Commands (IMPLEMENT changes)
These commands execute changes:
- `/sc:implement` → Writes code
- `/sc:improve` → Applies improvements (auto-fix for style, approval for architecture)
- `/sc:cleanup` → Removes dead code (auto-fix for unused imports, approval for referenced code)
- `/sc:task` → Discrete task execution (stops when complete)
- `/sc:test` → Runs tests
- `/sc:build` → Builds project
- `/sc:git` → Git operations

### Key Behavior Notes
- **Document-only commands** stop after producing their output and suggest next steps
- **Execution commands** have clear completion criteria
- **`/sc:troubleshoot`** is diagnose-first by default; use `--fix` flag to apply fixes
- **`/sc:improve`** and **`/sc:cleanup`** auto-fix safe changes, prompt for risky ones

---

## 📖 Detailed Description of Each Command

---

### `/sc:pm` - Project Manager Agent

**Status:** Always active automatically. This is a background layer, not a command.

**When to use:** No need to call explicitly — always running.

**What it does:**
- Automatically restores context from past sessions (Serena MCP)
- Delegates tasks to personas (backend, frontend, security...)
- Runs PDCA cycle: Plan → Do → Check → Act
- Saves progress between sessions

**Workflow:**
```
User: "I want to add authentication"
PM Agent:
  1. Activates Brainstorming Mode (if request is vague)
  2. Delegates to requirements-analyst
  3. Delegates to system-architect
  4. Delegates to security-engineer
  5. Delegates to backend-architect
  6. Delegates to quality-engineer
  7. Documents in CLAUDE.md
```

**MCP servers:** sequential, context7, magic, playwright, morphllm, serena, tavily, chrome-devtools

**Key patterns:**
- Session Start Protocol (context restoration)
- Self-Correcting Execution (root cause first!)
- PDCA Document Structure (`docs/pdca/[feature]/`)

---

### `/sc:spawn` - Meta-System Task Orchestration

**When to use:** Complex task that requires breaking down into many subtasks with dependencies.

**What it does:**
- Breaks down Epic → Story → Task → Subtask
- Selects strategy: sequential/parallel/adaptive
- Coordinates dependencies between tasks

**Syntax:**
```
/sc:spawn [complex-task] [--strategy sequential|parallel|adaptive] [--depth normal|deep]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Monolith migration
/sc:spawn "migrate legacy monolith to microservices" --strategy adaptive --depth deep
# Creates: Database design → Backend API → Frontend → Testing

# Feature with dependencies
/sc:spawn "implement user authentication system"
# Breakdown: Database design → Backend API → Frontend UI → Testing
```

**Difference from `/sc:task`:**
- spawn = decomposition (breaking down)
- task = execution (doing work)

---

### `/sc:task` - Enhanced Task Management

**When to use:** Need to execute a specific complex task with MCP server coordination.

**What it does:**
- Activates needed personas (architect, security, frontend...)
- Routes to correct MCP servers
- Parallel execution where possible
- Cross-session persistence via Serena

**Syntax:**
```
/sc:task [action] [target] [--strategy systematic|agile|enterprise] [--parallel] [--delegate]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Enterprise-level feature
/sc:task create "enterprise authentication system" --strategy systematic --parallel
# Activates architect + security + backend + frontend

# Agile sprint
/sc:task execute "feature backlog" --strategy agile --delegate
# Iterative execution with delegation
```

**MCP servers:** sequential, context7, magic, playwright, morphllm, serena

---

### `/sc:workflow` - Implementation Workflow Generator

**When to use:** Have a PRD/specification and need a step-by-step implementation plan.

**What it does:**
- Parses PRD document
- Generates workflow with dependencies
- Creates implementation plan by domains
- **Does NOT implement code**, only plans

**Syntax:**
```
/sc:workflow [prd-file|feature-description] [--strategy systematic|agile|enterprise] [--depth shallow|normal|deep] [--parallel]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# From PRD file
/sc:workflow docs/PRD/auth-feature.md --strategy systematic --depth deep
# Result: "1. DB schema → 2. API → 3. UI → 4. Tests"

# From description
/sc:workflow "user authentication system" --strategy agile --parallel
```

**Difference from `/sc:task`:**
- workflow = planning (generates roadmap)
- task = execution (actually does work)

---

### `/sc:orchestrate` - Staged Optimization Orchestrator

**When to use:** You want a single entry point: one command that decides scope, picks strategy (single session / in-session parallel / Agent Team), runs the work, and monitors for direction changes. Use when task size is unclear or you want to avoid choosing between Plan Mode, worktrees, or parallel execution yourself.

**What it does:**
- **Stage 1:** Lightweight plan (impact scope only), classifies scope as small / medium / large.
- **Stage 2:** Lists three strategies: single session, in-session parallel, Agent Team.
- **Stage 3:** Scores by cost, reproducibility, extensibility and **auto-selects** one (no user choice).
- **Stage 4:** Executes—single session, parallel tool waves, or creates a Claude Code [Agent Team](https://code.claude.com/docs/ja/agent-teams) when large.
- **Stage 5:** On direction change ("redo", "other approach"), compares to stored plan, shows rework risk, asks for confirmation before continuing.

**Syntax:**
```
/sc:orchestrate [task-description]
```

**Large scope and Agent Teams:** If the selected strategy is Agent Team, Claude Code's experimental [Agent Teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/ja/agent-teams) are used. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in your environment or in `.claude/settings.json` under `"env"`.

**Examples:**
```bash
/sc:orchestrate "add dark mode toggle"           # Often stays single session
/sc:orchestrate "refactor auth and add tests"   # May use in-session parallel
/sc:orchestrate "checkout flow: API, UI, E2E"    # May create Agent Team
```

---

### `/sc:brainstorm` - Interactive Requirements Discovery

**When to use:** Idea is vague, need to understand requirements through dialogue.

**What it does:**
- Asks Socratic questions for clarification
- Checks feasibility
- Generates concrete specifications
- Creates brief for implementation

**Syntax:**
```
/sc:brainstorm [topic/idea] [--strategy systematic|agile|enterprise] [--depth shallow|normal|deep] [--parallel]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# New product
/sc:brainstorm "AI-powered project management tool" --strategy systematic --depth deep
# Claude: What problems should it solve? For what team? Integrations?
# Result: Clear requirements document

# Feature
/sc:brainstorm "real-time collaboration features" --strategy agile --parallel
```

**MCP servers:** sequential, context7, magic, playwright, morphllm, serena

---

### `/sc:research` - Deep Web Research

**When to use:** Need up-to-date information from the internet.

**What it does:**
- Parallel web searches via Tavily

**Syntax:**
```
/sc:research "[query]" [--depth quick|standard|deep|exhaustive] [--strategy planning|intent|unified]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
/sc:research "latest developments in quantum computing 2024" --depth deep
/sc:research "competitive analysis of AI coding assistants" --depth exhaustive
```

**MCP servers:** tavily, sequential, playwright, serena

---

### `/sc:implement` - Feature Implementation

**When to use:** Know exactly what to do, need to write code.

**What it does:**
- Activates needed personas (frontend/backend/security)
- Uses Context7 for framework-specific patterns
- Magic MCP for UI components
- Generates code with tests

**Syntax:**
```
/sc:implement [feature-description] [--type component|api|service|feature] [--framework react|vue|express] [--safe] [--with-tests]
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# React component
/sc:implement user profile component --type component --framework react --with-tests

## ⚡ Key Differences (commonly confused)

| Command | Purpose | Result |
|---------|---------|--------|
| [`/sc:spawn`](#scspawn---meta-system-task-orchestration) | Decompose large task | Task hierarchy |
| [`/sc:task`](#sctask---enhanced-task-management) | Execute task with coordination | Finished result |
| [`/sc:workflow`](#scworkflow---implementation-workflow-generator) | Plan implementation | Roadmap/plan |
| [`/sc:design`](#scdesign---system-and-component-design) | Design | Diagrams, specs |
| [`/sc:implement`](#scimplement---feature-implementation) | Write code | Finished code |

## 🎯 spawn vs task vs implement — Detailed Comparison

### Analogy: Team Roles

| Command | Role | Writes code? |
|---------|------|--------------|
| [`/sc:spawn`](#scspawn---meta-system-task-orchestration) | Project Manager | ❌ **No** — only breaks down into tasks |
| [`/sc:task`](#sctask---enhanced-task-management) | Tech Lead | ⚠️ **Can** — through delegation |
| [`/sc:implement`](#scimplement---feature-implementation) | Developer | ✅ **Yes** — directly |

---

### `/sc:spawn` — Decomposition (planner)

**What it does:** Takes a large task and breaks it into a hierarchy of subtasks.

**Result:** Document/task structure, **NOT code**.

```
/sc:spawn "build e-commerce platform"

Result (structure only!):
Epic: E-commerce Platform
├── Story: User Authentication
│   ├── Task: Database schema for users
│   ├── Task: Auth API endpoints
│   └── Task: Login UI
├── Story: Product Catalog
│   ├── Task: Product model
│   └── Task: Search functionality
└── Story: Checkout
    ├── Task: Cart logic
    └── Task: Payment integration
```

**When to use:** Don't know where to start, task is huge, need to break into AI-friendly parts.

---

### `/sc:task` — Execution Coordination (Tech Lead)

**What it does:** Takes a specific task and executes with MCP server and persona orchestration.

**Result:** Can be code, but through delegation (activates needed tools).

```
/sc:task create "user authentication" --strategy systematic --parallel

Workflow:
1. Activates architect persona → designs
2. Activates security persona → reviews
3. Activates backend persona → writes code (calls implement internally)
4. Activates qa persona → tests
```

**When to use:** Complex task requiring coordination across domains (security + backend + frontend simultaneously).

---

### `/sc:implement` — Code Writing (Developer)

**What it does:** Directly writes code.

**Result:** Finished code.

```
/sc:implement user login form --type component --framework react --with-tests

Result:
- src/components/LoginForm.tsx (created)
- src/components/LoginForm.test.tsx (created)
```

**When to use:** Know exactly what's needed, just need to write it.

---

### How They Connect

```
/sc:spawn "build auth system"        ← Breaks into tasks
    │
    ├── Creates Task: "Design auth architecture"
    │       └── Can execute via /sc:design
    │
    ├── Creates Task: "Implement auth API"
    │       └── Can execute via /sc:task or /sc:implement
    │
    └── Creates Task: "Build login UI"
            └── Can execute via /sc:implement
```

Or `/sc:task` can call `/sc:implement` internally:

```
/sc:task execute "auth system" --parallel
    │
    ├── Delegates backend → calls /sc:implement auth API
    ├── Delegates frontend → calls /sc:implement login form
    └── Delegates security → calls /sc:analyze --focus security
```

---

### When to Use What — Quick Reference

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| "Want to do X, but don't know how to break it down" | [`/sc:spawn`](#scspawn---meta-system-task-orchestration) |
| "Need to do X, requires backend + security + tests" | [`/sc:task`](#sctask---enhanced-task-management) |
| "Write me component Y" | [`/sc:implement`](#scimplement---feature-implementation) |
| "Need implementation plan from PRD" | [`/sc:workflow`](#scworkflow---implementation-workflow-generator) |

---

### Short Formula

- **spawn** = planner (task document only, **never writes code**)
- **task** = coordinator (can write code through delegation to other commands)
- **implement** = executor (writes code directly)

---

## 🤔 task vs implement — When to Choose Which?

### When task is better than implement

| Situation | Better |
|-----------|--------|
| Feature spans multiple domains (API + UI + security) | [`/sc:task`](#sctask---enhanced-task-management) |
| Need architectural review before coding | [`/sc:task`](#sctask---enhanced-task-management) |
| Working in unfamiliar codebase | [`/sc:task`](#sctask---enhanced-task-management) |
| Critical feature (auth, payments) | [`/sc:task`](#sctask---enhanced-task-management) |

### When implement is better than task

| Situation | Better |
|-----------|--------|
| Single component / single function | [`/sc:implement`](#scimplement---feature-implementation) |
| Know exactly what and how to do | [`/sc:implement`](#scimplement---feature-implementation) |
| Simple CRUD | [`/sc:implement`](#scimplement---feature-implementation) |
| Already did design/architecture | [`/sc:implement`](#scimplement---feature-implementation) |

### Why not always use task?

**Coordination overhead** — task spends tokens on "meetings":

```
/sc:task "add logout button"

task thinks:
  1. Activate architect? → overkill for a button
  2. Activate security? → logout is simple
  3. Activate frontend? → ok
  4. Activate qa? → for a button?

Result: spent tokens on coordination for a single button
```

vs

```
/sc:implement logout button --type component --framework react

implement:
  1. Reads existing code
  2. Writes button
  3. Done
```

### Analogy

- **task** = schedule a meeting with 5 people to solve the task
- **implement** = just do the task yourself

For complex tasks, meetings are needed. For "add a button" — no.

### Practical Rule

```
Task concerns 1 domain (only frontend OR only backend)?
  → /sc:implement

Task concerns 2+ domains (frontend + backend + security)?
  → /sc:task

Unsure about architecture?
  → /sc:task (or first /sc:design)

Critical code (auth, payments, data)?
  → /sc:task (extra checks don't hurt)
```

## 📐 design vs workflow — Blueprint vs Work Plan

| Command | Question | Result |
|---------|----------|--------|
| [`/sc:design`](#scdesign---system-and-component-design) | **WHAT** to build? | Architecture, schemas, specifications |
| [`/sc:workflow`](#scworkflow---implementation-workflow-generator) | **IN WHAT ORDER** to do it? | Work plan, roadmap, steps |

---

### `/sc:design` — Architecture (blueprint)

**Answers:** How is the system structured? What components? How are they connected?

```
/sc:design payment-system --type architecture

Result:
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Client    │────▶│  API Gateway │────▶│  Payment    │
│   (React)   │     │  (Express)   │     │  Service    │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                        ┌─────────────┐
                                        │   Stripe    │
                                        │   Webhook   │
                                        └─────────────┘

+ API contracts
+ Database schema
+ Security requirements
```

---

### `/sc:workflow` — Work Plan (roadmap)

**Answers:** In what order to do it? What dependencies? What's parallel?

```
/sc:workflow payment-system --strategy systematic

Result:
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
  ├── Task 1.1: Setup database schema
  ├── Task 1.2: Create Payment model
  └── Task 1.3: Configure Stripe SDK

Phase 2: Backend (Week 2)
  ├── Task 2.1: Implement payment endpoints ← depends on 1.1, 1.2
  ├── Task 2.2: Add webhook handler ← depends on 1.3
  └── Task 2.3: Write unit tests

Phase 3: Frontend (Week 2-3) ← can start parallel with 2.2
  ├── Task 3.1: Payment form component
  └── Task 3.2: Confirmation page

Phase 4: Integration (Week 3)
  └── Task 4.1: E2E tests ← depends on all above
```

### Analogy: Building a House

| Stage | Command | What you get |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| House blueprint | `/sc:design` | Where walls go, where windows, what materials |
| Construction plan | `/sc:workflow` | First foundation → walls → roof → finishing |

---

### How design and workflow are connected

```
1. /sc:brainstorm "payment system"     → Requirements (WHAT we want)
          │
          ▼
2. /sc:design payment-system           → Architecture (HOW it's structured)
          │
          ▼
3. /sc:workflow payment-system         → Plan (IN WHAT ORDER)
          │
          ▼
4. /sc:implement ... (following plan)  → Code
```

---

### When design, when workflow

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| "How should system X be structured?" | [`/sc:design`](#scdesign---system-and-component-design) |
| "In what order to implement feature Y?" | [`/sc:workflow`](#scworkflow---implementation-workflow-generator) |
| "Need API spec for service Z" | [`/sc:design`](#scdesign---system-and-component-design) `--type api` |
| "Break PRD into tasks with dependencies" | [`/sc:workflow`](#scworkflow---implementation-workflow-generator) |
| "What database schema is needed?" | [`/sc:design`](#scdesign---system-and-component-design) `--type database` |
| "How many phases in implementation?" | [`/sc:workflow`](#scworkflow---implementation-workflow-generator) `--depth deep` |

---

## 📂 index-repo vs Serena — Indexing Tools Comparison

### What Each Tool Creates

| Tool | Creates files | Where stored |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| [`/sc:index-repo`](#scindex-repo---repository-indexing) | `PROJECT_INDEX.md` (3KB) | Project root |
| **Serena MCP** | `.serena/project.yml` + `.serena/memories/*.md` | `.serena/` folder in project |

### Serena File Structure

```
.serena/
├── project.yml              # Configuration (languages, encoding, LSP settings)
├── .gitignore               # Git ignore
└── memories/
    ├── project_overview.md      # About the project, tech stack
    ├── suggested_commands.md    # Development commands
    ├── style_conventions.md     # Code styles and conventions
    └── task_completion.md       # Task completion checklist
```

---

### Key Differences

| Aspect | [`/sc:index-repo`](#scindex-repo---repository-indexing) | **Serena MCP** |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Type** | Static file | Live LSP server + memories |
| **Main goal** | Quick start (token savings) | Semantic code understanding |
| **What it understands** | File structure | Symbols (functions, classes, types) |
| **Updates** | Manual (`mode=update`) | Memories — manual, LSP — automatic |
| **Persistence** | File in project | Files in `.serena/memories/` |
| **LSP operations** | ❌ No | ✅ rename, find references, go to definition |
| **Cross-session** | ✅ Read file | ✅ Memories are persistent |
| **Tokens at start** | ~3K (reading INDEX) | On demand (reading needed memories) |

---

### When to Use What

**[`/sc:index-repo`](#scindex-repo---repository-indexing)** — for quick session start:
- Project structure overview
- Entry points and key modules
- Dependencies and configuration
- Quick start commands
- **Savings**: 58K → 3K tokens at start

**Serena MCP** — for deep code work:
- `find_symbol` — find class/function by name
- `find_referencing_symbols` — where symbol is used
- `rename_symbol` — rename everywhere safely via LSP
- `get_symbols_overview` — file structure (class methods etc.)
- **Memories** — persistent notes about project across sessions

---

### Recommendation

**Either one is sufficient** to start working:

| If you chose | What you get | Each session |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Serena** (recommended) | Memories + LSP + symbols | No need to read anything |
| [**index-repo**](#scindex-repo---repository-indexing) | PROJECT_INDEX.md | Can read for context |
| **Both** | Maximum information | Optional |

```bash
# Initial setup (once)
serena activate_project .         # Activate project
serena onboarding                 # Create memories
# and/or
/sc:index-repo                    # Create PROJECT_INDEX.md

# On structural changes
/sc:index-repo mode=update        # Update INDEX (if using)
serena edit_memory ...            # Update memories (if needed)
```

**Important**: SuperClaude commands automatically use Serena for code work.
Explicitly reading PROJECT_INDEX.md or calling `serena read_memory` each session is **not required**.

---

### Auto-update?

| What | Auto-updates? | How to update |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| `PROJECT_INDEX.md` | ❌ No | [`/sc:index-repo`](#scindex-repo---repository-indexing) `mode=update` |
| Serena memories | ❌ No | `write_memory` / `edit_memory` |
| Serena LSP understanding | ✅ Yes | Automatically sees file changes |

---

### When to Update?

| Event | [index-repo](#scindex-repo---repository-indexing) | Serena memories |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| Added new module/folder | ✅ Update | ⚡ Optional |
| Renamed module | ✅ Update | ⚡ Optional |
| Fixed bug in file | ❌ Not needed | ❌ Not needed |
| Added dependency | ✅ Update | ❌ Not needed |
| Changed code conventions | ❌ Not needed | ✅ Update |
| Before PR/release | ⚡ Good practice | ❌ Not needed |

---

## 🔄 Typical Workflows

### New Project (initial setup)
```
# Option A: Via Serena (recommended)
1. serena activate_project .         # Activate project
2. serena onboarding                 # Create memories (project_overview, commands, etc.)

# Option B: Via index-repo
1. /sc:index-repo                    # Create PROJECT_INDEX.md

# Can use both — they complement each other
```

> **Important**: Add Serena auto-activation instruction to project CLAUDE.md:
> ```
> mcp__serena__activate_project project="."
> ```
> Then Claude will activate Serena automatically at the start of each session.
